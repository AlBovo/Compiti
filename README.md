# Compiti
This repository contains all the exercises and programs that I made in C# during the school year 2023/2024.<br>
The repository is organized like this:
+ [`Informatica`](./Informatica/): This directory contains all the computer science projects.
+ [`Sistemi e Reti`](./SistemiReti/): This directory contains all the assembly and bash scripts made at school.
+ [`TPSIT`](./TecnProg/): This directory contains all the miscellaneous projects made during TPSIT's hours.

There's also another directory - [`Emulazione Processore`](./EmulazioneProcessore/) which is a virtual machine made in C# to run some games.
